# Schlipak's theme for fish

This theme is based on agnoster theme, but isn't Powerline-themed.
It features a two line prompt, showing info such as:

- If the previous return status was different than 0
- If the current user is root
- If there are background jobs
- The current username and host (host::user)
- The current working directory, without the usual fish abbreviation
- If the user is in a Git/SVN/Mercurial repository, and some status infos
- On a new line, the prompt arrow. Turns to a red #> if the user is root.
